# Question 4

Given the following two collections:

```python
a_tuple = (19, 33, 12)
a_list = range(0, 10)
```

What's the final value of `result`?

```python
result = a_list[3**2 - 8] + a_list[-1] + a_tuple[2]
```

**Important:** Replace `X` with your answer. Example, if you think that the correct answer is `49` your final code will look like:

```python
def question_4():
    return 49
```
