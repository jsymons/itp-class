# Question 3

Extend the class `Circle` by including a `get_area` method. A Circle is created by passing its radius and the `__init__` method is already defined for you. Your only task is to create the `get_area` method and return the area of the circle. The area of a circle is defined as `πr²`. You can approximate pi with `3.14`. See examples below:

```python
c1 = Circle(radius=1)
c1.get_area()  # 3.14

c2 = Circle(radius=3)
c2.get_area()  # 9.42

c3 = Circle(radius=9)
c3.get_area()  # 28.26

# Calculate Area example
PI = 3.14
radius = 3
area = PI * (radius ** 2)
```
