# Set Operations (Intersection)

Create a function that will return a set of all the common elements of two lists. 

```list_1 = [1,5,6,4,8]
list_2 = [1,6,10,5]

all_common_elements(list_1, list2) #{1,5,6}```

The function should additionally check to see that the parameters are list objects. If they aren't, the function should return a string that says "params not of type 'list'".
